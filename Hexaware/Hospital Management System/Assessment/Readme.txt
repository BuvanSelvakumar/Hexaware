Modules Implemented:

- Entity classes: Patient, Doctor, Appointment
- Interface: IHospitalService
- Implementation: HospitalServiceImpl
- Custom Exception: PatientNumberNotFoundException
- Menu-Driven Console App (MainModule)
- Database connection logic using SQL Server


Note:

All project code is written and ready. Due to a system-specific SQL Server instance access issue, the live DB connection could not be established. However, the application logic is complete and structured correctly.
